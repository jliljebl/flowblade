# Code contributions

**Reqiured skills** Flowblade is Python application so to get going you will need to have some experience in working in that language.

* There are many tasks that could maybe taken on at let's say beginner+ level of competence.
* Solid medium level will very likely be adequate to handle most tasks.
* You need be able to work with **git** and create pull requests using Github's available features.

**How to get started** Flowblade is a large and complex enough codebase that the first problem with contributing is to know how the codebase works. However, it is not necessary to fully understand the codebase to do useful work.

* We have a document to help with getting to know the inner workings [here.](codeoverview/CodebaseOverview.md)
