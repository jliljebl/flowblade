    Behind the scenes, a temp file will be created in /path/to/, and when
    the context manager block goes out of scope, the temp file will be
    atomically renamed to /path/to/file.

    POSIX guarantees that rename() is an atomic operation, so on any
    reasonable UNIX filesystem, the file will either show up in the
    destination path with all of its contents, or it won't show up at all.
    Additionally, if a file was already in the destination path, it will
    not be corrupted. Either it will be cleanly overwritten, or it will
    be preserved in its former state without modification.
