<h3>Creating a New Project</h3>
<p>
Flowblade Movie Editor saves work in project files.
</p>
<p>
To create a new Project:
</p>
<ul>
<li> <b>Menu:</b> Select <b>File -> New</b> from menu.</li>
<li> <b>Keyboard Shortcut:</b> Press <b>Control+N</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>
A project contains:
</p>
 <ul>
<li> one or more Sequences of edited media</li>
<li> a collection of Media Files stored in Bins.</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are two parameters that can be selected for a new project:
</p>
<ul style="list-style-type:none">
<li> <b>Project Profile</b> Project Profile determines frame rate per second, image size in pixels and pixel aspect ratio.</li>
<li> <b>Tracks count</b> Select the number of video and audio tracks that are used in the project. This can be changed later, but the operation destroys the Undo / Redo stack and all the Timeline Clips that do not fit in the newly created version of the Sequence.</li>
</ul>

<div class="note">
Video material is internally scaled to profile dimensions, so selecting Project Profile with smaller pixel dimensions than the rendered output leads to decreased quality.
</div>
<div class="note">
Flowblade Movie Editor handles image data internally as YUV420 frames, so the encoding associated with a given profile has no affect on quality before rendering.
</div>
<div class="note">
For <b>best possible quality</b> the <b>input material, Project Profile and Rendering Profile</b> should <b>all have the same pixel dimensions</b> and pixel aspect ratio.
</div>

<h3>Adding and removing new Sequences</h3>
<p>
A Project contains one or more Sequences. The term Sequence refers to the full contents of the timeline forming a program, a movie.
</p>

<p>
For complex projects it is sometimes best to use multiple sequences for creating and managing different parts of the finished product.
</p>

<p>
<b>Adding Sequences:</b>
</p>
<ul>
<li> <b>3 panel layout:</b> Press <b>Right Mouse</b> popup menu on Sequences area and select menu item <b>Add New Sequence</b>..</li>
<li> <b>2 panel layout:</b> Press <b>Right Mouse</b> popup menu in the <b>Project</b> tab <b>Sequences</b> area and select menu item <b>Add New Sequence</b>.</li>
<li> Or select  <b>Project -> Sequence -> Add New Sequence</b> from application menu.</li>
</ul>


<p>
<b>Deleting Sequences</b> can be done with menu actions accessed in the same places.
</p>

<div class="note">
<p>
When creating a new Sequence, you can choose the number of Tracks in the Sequence. This can be changed later, but the operation destroys the Undo / Redo stack and all the Timeline Clips that do not fit in the newly created version of the Sequence.
</p>
</div>

<h3>Working with Media Files</h3>

<p>
Flowblade Movie Editor holds files in <b>Media</b> tab. Files are listed in unnamed table that displays contents of the currently selected Bin. Bins are listed in the <b>Bins</b> table.
</p>

<p>
<b>Opening Media Files:</b>
</p>

<ol>
<li> Press <b>Right Mouse</b> on <b>Media</b> tab empty area and select menu item <b>Add Video, Audio or Image...</b>.
<li> Or select  <b>Project -> Add Video, Audio or Image...</b> from application menu.
<li> Use dialog to find and select files.</li>
<li> Files are displayed as thumbnails.</li>
<li> Note that creating thumbnails for opened files will take some time.</li>
</ol>

<div class="note">
<h3 style="margin-top:10px">Project Media: Absolute and relative paths</h3>
<ul>
<li> Flowblade <b>saves references</b> to media files used in a project as <b>absolute paths</b>.</li>
<li> If a media is <b>not found on load</b>, Flowblade attempts to find a media file with the same name in subfolders relative to the project file.</li>
<li> If all media used by a project is saved in subfolders relative to project file, <b>project file and media can moved as a unit</b> and the project will load successfully after data is copied to a different place</li>
<li> <b>Rendered files</b> like transitions <b>are saved by default in a hidden folder</b> <i><home folder>/.flowblade/rendered_clips/</i>.</li>
<li> Menu item <b>File->Save Backup Snapshot...</b> saves project file, all media and rendered files in a single folder that can saved as unit and and project can always be loaded using this data </li>
<li> <b>Load order</b> between absolute and relative paths can be set in preferences window</li>
<li> <b>Media Relinker</b> tool can be used to fix problems that may occur </li>

</ul>
<p><b>NOTE:</b> Information given here only applies to version 0.18 and above.</p>
</div>

<h3>Working with Bins</h3>

<p>
In video editing a bin is a named location for storing media. The term is used in Avid and was earlier used by film editors.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Adding a Bin:</b>
<p>
<ul>
<li> <b>3 panel layout:</b> Press <b>Right Mouse</b> on Bin area to launch a popup menu and select menu item <b>Add Bin</b>.</li>
<li> <b>2 panel layout:</b> Press <b>Right Mouse</b> in the <b>Media</b> tab <b>Bins</b> panel to launch a popup menu and select menu item <b>Add Bin</b>.</li>
<li> Or select  <b>Project -> Bin -> Add Bin</b> from application menu.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Deleting a Bin</b>: Delete actions can be accessed from the same places as above.</p>
<p><b>Renaming a Bin</b>: Click on the Bin name, type new name and press <b>Enter</b>.</p>
<p><b>Moving files to another Bin:</b></p>
<ul>
<li> Select and drag files on top of the Bin you wish to move the files into.</li>
<li> Select files and open <b>Hamburger menu</b> in <b>Media</b> panel and select menu item <b>Move Selected media to Bin</b> and then the menu item with the Bins name.</li>
</ul>
<div class="tabbed">

<h3>Adding clips to Sequence </h3>

<h4>Drag'n'Drop</h4>
<p> Press on a Media File in <b>Media</b> tab and drag it on top of the track you want to place it on.</p>

<ul>

<ul>
<li> Clip will be inserted on the track at the nearest cut. </li>
</ul>
</ul>

<h4>From Monitor</h4>

</ul>
</ol>

<h3>Editing Clips on Timeline</h3>
<p>
Once you have placed clips on the Timeline to form a Sequence, you will probably need to refine the cuts between clips.
</p>
<h4>Trimming Clips</h4>
<p>
Use <a href="edit_tools.html#trim">Trim Tool</a>,  <a href="edit_tools.html#roll">Roll Tool</a>, <a href="edit_tools.html#slip">Slip Tool</a> or <a href="edit_tools.html#multitrim">Multitrim Tool</a>.
</p>

<h4>Moving Clips</h4>
<p>
Use  <a href="edit_tools.html#insert">Insert Tool</a>,  <a href="edit_tools.html#overwrite">Move Tool</a>, <a href="edit_tools.html#spacer">Spacer Tool</a> or <a href="edit_tools.html#box">Box Tool</a>.
</p>

<h4>Cutting Clips</h4>
<ol>
<li>Select cut frame</li>
<ul>
<li> Cut is always made before the currently displayed frame on all active tracks.</li>
</ul>
<li>Cut clip</li>
<ul>
<li> Press <b>Cut</b> button or press <b>X</b> on the keyboard.</li>
</ul>
</ol>


<h4>Deleting Clips</h4>
<p><b>Splice Out</b>: Select clip(s) and press <b>Delete</b> key or use the <b>Splice Out</b> button on middle bar. All the clips in the track after the deleted clip(s) are moved to left to cover the created empty space.</p>
<p><b>Lift</b>: Select clip(s) and press the <b>Lift</b> button on the middle bar. Clip is replaced with a blank if it is in middle of track. Other clips on the track are not moved.
<p><b>Ripple Delete</b>: Select clip(s) and press the <b>Ripple Delete</b> button on middle bar. All the clips on <b>all tracks</b> are moved forward to cover the created empty space. If moving clips backwards would cause an overwrite to happen on timeline, edit is not allowed.</p>
<p><b>Range Delete</b>: Set <b>Mark In</b> and <b>Mark out</b> on timeline and and press the <b>Range Delete</b> button on middle bar. All the clips and blanks on <b>all tracks</b> are deleted between marks and everything after deleted range is moved forward the length of the deleted range.</p>

<div class="note">
<p><b>Fade/Transition cover delete</b>: Select a single rendered fade or transition clip and press <b>Delete</b> key or button. If clips before and after of the deleted clip have frames available, then the space left by the deleted clip will covered using material from adjacent clips. If material is not available a splice out will be performed. A preference exists to always perform splice out on fades and transitions.
</div>
<div class="note">
<b>Use Keyboard Shortcuts!</b> It is much faster to use <b>X</b> key to cut clips and <b>Delete</b> key to splice out clips than it is to use buttons for the same operations.
</div>
