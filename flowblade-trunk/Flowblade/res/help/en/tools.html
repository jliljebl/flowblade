<h3> G'Mic Effects</h3>
<p>
G'MIC is a full-featured open-source framework for image processing.
</p>
<p>
Flowblade G'MIC tool presents user with a selection of commads that can be used to achieve complex filtering of video clips.</p>
<p>
<b>NOTE: If a command is not present in the system then the corresponding filtering selection will not work.</b>
</p>
<p>
Commands are mostly embedded in the <b>/usr/bin/gmic</b> binary itself, so to have access to more commands you will mostly need to upgrade the binary in your system.
</p>
<p>
It is however possible to add and use custom commands and use them for video filtering, <a href="  http://gmic.eu/reference.shtml#section11">more info here.</a>
